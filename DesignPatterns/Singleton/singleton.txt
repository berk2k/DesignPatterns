Singleton Pattern is a widely used design pattern in software development. It ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. 
It’s particularly useful when it doesn’t make sense to have multiple instances of a class or when only one instance is needed to manage certain functionalities.

Why Use It?
In some systems, it is necessary to use the same instance of a class throughout the application. For example:

Logger class: It is preferable to use the same instance for logging so that the same logging system is used everywhere in the application.

Cache mechanism: The same cache data can be accessed from different parts of the application.

Database connection: Ensures that the same database connection is used across the entire application.
Key Features of the Singleton Pattern:
	Single instance: Only one instance of the class is created, and this instance is shared throughout the application.
	Global access point: The instance is typically provided through a static method, allowing access from anywhere.
	Lazy initialization: The instance is created only when it is needed (e.g., the first time it is accessed).
Advantages of Singleton:
	Controlled resource usage: Since only one instance is used, resources such as memory and CPU are used more efficiently.
	Consistency: The same instance is accessed everywhere in the application, ensuring consistency.
	Global access: The instance of the class can be easily accessed from anywhere in the application.
Disadvantages:
	Global state: Since it can be accessed globally, it can be difficult to control and manage, similar to global variables.
	Difficult to test: In testing scenarios, it can be hard to mock the Singleton instance since the instance is usually fixed.
	Multi-threading issues: In multi-threaded applications, managing Singleton instances properly can be challenging (in this case, thread-safe Singleton methods should be used).
